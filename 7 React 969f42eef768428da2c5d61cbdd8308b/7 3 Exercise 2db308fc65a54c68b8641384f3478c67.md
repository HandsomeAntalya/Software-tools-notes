# 7.3 Exercise

## Character design exercise

The final React exercise today is to write a "character design" React app. Functionality is your first priority, before design: it's ok to lay out everything in simple paragraphs one above the other.

The constraints are:

- There are four stats, called *Charisma, Prowess, Agility* and *Strength*.
- You have 4 stat points to spend in total, but you may not spend more than 2 points on the same stat.
- You should make a reusable "stat editor" component that displays the points allocated to a stat and has +/- buttons to change these, and displays the name of the stat.
- The buttons must be enabled when you are allowed to increase/decrease the stat in question, and disabled otherwise.
- You should also make a separate component that displays the number of stat points remaining to spend (this was not in the example in the lectures).

You can ignore the character's name for now.

The design question here is where to put the functions that access or manipulate state. For example you will probably want a function somewhere that returns the number of stat points remaining to spend.

You will also need to think about how you can make a *reusable* stat editor component, so that you can include it four times in the app's render method. The design question here is which props you pass to the component - each of the four copies of the stat editor will need a different value for at least one of the props. The solution shown in the lectures is just one of many possibilities.

*First of all, let’s create the react app named ‘character’*

```jsx
npx create-react-app character
```

*And we have successfully created the App:*

To create the "character design" React app, you can follow these steps:

1. Define the state of your app, which should include an object with the initial values of your stats and the remaining stat points:

```jsx
state = {
  stats: {
    charisma: 0,
    prowess: 0,
    agility: 0,
    strength: 0
  },
  remainingPoints: 4
}

```

1. Create a reusable "stat editor" component that receives the name and value of a stat, as well as a callback function to update the state:

```jsx
function StatEditor(props) {
  const { name, value, onIncrement, onDecrement, isDisabled } = props;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{name}</h2>
      <button onClick={onIncrement} disabled={isDisabled}>+</button>
      <span>{value}</span>
      <button onClick={onDecrement} disabled={isDisabled}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

1. Define the callback functions that will update the state when a stat is incremented or decremented:

```jsx
handleIncrement = (stat) => {
  const { stats, remainingPoints } = this.state;

  if (remainingPoints > 0 && stats[stat] < 2) {
    this.setState({
      stats: {
        ...stats,
        [stat]: stats[stat] + 1
      },
      remainingPoints: remainingPoints - 1
    });
  }
};

handleDecrement = (stat) => {
  const { stats, remainingPoints } = this.state;

  if (stats[stat] > 0) {
    this.setState({
      stats: {
        ...stats,
        [stat]: stats[stat] - 1
      },
      remainingPoints: remainingPoints + 1
    });
  }
};

```

1. Create four instances of the "stat editor" component, passing the appropriate props to each one:

```jsx
render() {
  const { stats, remainingPoints } = this.state;

  return (
    <div>
      <StatEditor
        name="Charisma"
        value={stats.charisma}
        onIncrement={() => this.handleIncrement("charisma")}
        onDecrement={() => this.handleDecrement("charisma")}
        isDisabled={stats.charisma === 2 || remainingPoints === 0}
      />
      <StatEditor
        name="Prowess"
        value={stats.prowess}
        onIncrement={() => this.handleIncrement("prowess")}
        onDecrement={() => this.handleDecrement("prowess")}
        isDisabled={stats.prowess === 2 || remainingPoints === 0}
      />
      <StatEditor
        name="Agility"
        value={stats.agility}
        onIncrement={() => this.handleIncrement("agility")}
        onDecrement={() => this.handleDecrement("agility")}
        isDisabled={stats.agility === 2 || remainingPoints === 0}
      />
      <StatEditor
        name="Strength"
        value={stats.strength}
        onIncrement={() => this.handleIncrement("strength")}
        onDecrement={() => this.handleDecrement("strength")}
        isDisabled={stats.strength === 2 || remainingPoints === 0}
      />
      <div>Remaining points: {remainingPoints}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

That's it! You should now have a functioning "character design" React app that allows you to allocate 4 points across 4 stats, with a maximum of 2 points per stat. The app should also display the remaining points that can be allocated.

And we got the result looks like this:

![截屏2023-04-20 15.47.03.png](7%203%20Exercise%202db308fc65a54c68b8641384f3478c67/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-20_15.47.03.png)

After we implement some CSS style: 

```css
.App {
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.StatEditor {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.StatEditor button {
  font-size: 20px;
  padding: 5px 10px;
}

.RemainingPoints {
  font-size: 14px;
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

it will look like this:
