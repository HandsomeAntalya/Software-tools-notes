The history of web layout has evolved significantly since the inception of the World Wide Web. Here's a brief overview of the major milestones in the development of web layout techniques:

1. **Early HTML (1990s)**: In the early days of the web, layout options were limited. Web pages were primarily text-based, and designers used basic HTML tags like **`<h1>`**, **`<p>`**, and **`<ul>`** to create simple, linear designs. There was no concept of advanced layout or styling, and pages often looked plain and unpolished.
2. **Table-based layouts (mid-1990s)**: As the web matured, designers started using HTML tables to create more complex layouts. Tables allowed designers to create grid-based designs and control the positioning of elements on the page. However, tables were cumbersome to work with and often led to bloated, slow-loading pages.
3. **CSS and the separation of content and presentation (late 1990s)**: The introduction of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) revolutionized web layout by allowing designers to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This made it easier to create consistent styles across multiple pages, improve accessibility, and maintain websites more efficiently.
4. **CSS-based layouts (early 2000s)**: As CSS support improved in browsers, designers started using CSS for layout purposes. Techniques like floats and positioning enabled more flexible and sophisticated layouts, while also reducing the reliance on table-based designs.
5. **Fixed-width layouts (mid-2000s)**: During this period, fixed-width layouts became popular as they provided more control over the appearance of a website across different screen sizes. Many websites used a fixed-width container (often around 960 pixels wide) to center content and ensure consistent presentation.
6. **CSS frameworks and grid systems (late 2000s)**: CSS frameworks like Blueprint, 960.gs, and eventually Bootstrap and Foundation emerged to provide pre-built grid systems and design components. These frameworks helped streamline the web design process and create more consistent, responsive layouts.
7. **Responsive web design (2010s)**: With the rapid growth of mobile devices, designers needed to create websites that looked good and functioned well on various screen sizes. Responsive web design, introduced by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, used fluid grids, flexible images, and CSS media queries to create adaptable layouts that responded to the user's device and screen size.
8. **CSS Flexbox (2010s)**: Flexbox is a CSS layout module that makes it easier to create flexible, responsive designs without relying on floats or positioning. It allows designers to create complex layouts with simpler and more intuitive code, and it's well-suited for one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns).
9. **CSS Grid (2017)**: CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows designers to create complex, two-dimensional layouts using native CSS. It provides a high level of control over both rows and columns and enables the creation of more advanced and responsive designs with less code.

![截屏2023-04-22 21.17.59.png](CSS%20Grid-(lecture)%209c47732d34064280935e53f8742084a4/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_21.17.59.png)

The Holy Grail Layout is a classic web design pattern that consists of a header, a footer, and three columns in the middle: a main content area in the center and two sidebars (one on the left and one on the right). The layout gets its name from the challenges designers faced in creating this type of layout with early web technologies like tables and floats, as it was difficult to achieve equal-height columns and consistent positioning across various browsers.

The Holy Grail Layout looks like this:

```markdown

-----------------------------------
|             Header              |
-----------------------------------
|  Left  |   Main Content   | Right|
| Sidebar|                  |Sidebar|
|        |                  |      |
-----------------------------------
|             Footer              |
-----------------------------------

```

With the advent of modern CSS techniques, creating a Holy Grail Layout is now much simpler. You can achieve this layout using Flexbox or CSS Grid.

Here's an example using  CSS Grid:

1. Create the HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Holy Grail Layout</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>Header</header>
    <aside class="left">Left Sidebar</aside>
    <main>Main Content</main>
    <aside class="right">Right Sidebar</aside>
    <footer>Footer</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

1.  Add the CSS Grid styles:

```css
body {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
    grid-template-areas:
        "header header header"
        "left main right"
        "footer footer footer";
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
}

header {
    grid-area: header;
    background-color: #f1c40f;
    padding: 20px;
}

.left {
    grid-area: left;
    background-color: #3498db;
    padding: 20px;
}

main {
    grid-area: main;
    background-color: #2ecc71;
    padding: 20px;
}

.right {
    grid-area: right;
    background-color: #e74c3c;
    padding: 20px;
}

footer {
    grid-area: footer;
    background-color: #9b59b6;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

In the CSS code above, we define a grid layout on the body element with three columns and three rows. We then assign the grid areas to the header, left sidebar, main content, right sidebar, and footer elements. The grid-template-areas property is used to create the Holy Grail layout with the specified column and row structure.

200px (左边的这一列)

1fr: available element  (右边的那一长条)

**`1fr`** is a unit of measurement in CSS Grid that represents a fraction of the available space in a grid container. The **`fr`** unit (short for "fraction") is used to define the size of grid tracks (rows or columns) in a grid layout. It allows for the distribution of the remaining free space in the grid container among the grid tracks, creating a flexible and responsive layout.

When you define the size of a grid track using **`fr`**, it calculates the available free space in the grid container after accounting for any fixed-size tracks or gaps. The free space is then divided into equal parts based on the number of **`fr`** units assigned to the grid tracks.

For example, if you have a grid with three columns and you set their sizes as **`1fr`**, **`2fr`**, and **`1fr`**, the available space will be divided into four equal parts. The first and third columns will each take one part (25% of the available space), and the second column will take two parts (50% of the available space).

Here's a simple example:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

In this example, the grid container has three columns, with the first and third columns taking up 25% of the available space each, and the second column taking up 50% of the available space. The **`fr`** unit allows for the creation of flexible, responsive grid layouts that adapt to the container's size.

what :  ‘grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr’ ; will look like: 

```css
| 25% width |      50% width      | 25% width |
----------------------------------------------
|  1fr      |         2fr         |   1fr     |
```

# Responsive CSS

**Responsive CSS** is a design approach that aims to create web pages that look and function well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. The idea is to create a single website that can adapt its layout, images, and other elements to provide an optimal viewing experience for users, regardless of the device they are using.

Responsive design is achieved through a combination of flexible grids, fluid images, and CSS media queries. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **Flexible grids**: Instead of using fixed-width layouts (e.g., 960px wide), responsive designs use relative units like percentages, **`em`**, **`rem`**, or viewport units (**`vw`**, **`vh`**, **`vmin`**, **`vmax`**) to define the width and height of elements. This allows the layout to adapt to the available screen space and maintain proper proportions.
2. **Fluid images**: Images in responsive designs should also scale and adapt to the screen size. This is usually achieved by setting the width of images to a percentage value (e.g., **`width: 100%`**) to ensure they never exceed the width of their containing element.
3. **CSS media queries**: Media queries are a feature of CSS that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, or device type. By using media queries, you can create breakpoints in your CSS that define different styles for different screen sizes, making your design adapt to various devices.

Here's a simple example of a responsive CSS design:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Responsive CSS Example</title>
<style>
  .container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
  }

  img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
    }

    img {
      width: 48%;
    }
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <img src="example-image-1.jpg" alt="Example Image 1">
    <img src="example-image-2.jpg" alt="Example Image 2">
  </div>
</body>
</html>

```

In this example, the **`.container`** has a width of 100% and a maximum width of 1200px. Images inside the container are set to 100% width, so they scale according to the screen size. The media query at the bottom applies a flexbox layout and adjusts the image width to 48% when the screen width is 768px or larger. This makes the design responsive, adapting to both small and large screens.

How will our website looks like on a paper 

Media queries are a feature of CSS that allows you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, resolution, or device type. They are a key component of responsive web design and enable you to create websites that adapt to various devices and screen sizes.

A media query consists of a media type (e.g., **`screen`**, **`print`**, **`speech`**) and one or more expressions that check for specific conditions, like the width or height of the viewport. If the conditions are met, the styles within the media query block are applied.

Here's a simple example of a media query:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles to be applied if the screen width is 768 pixels or larger */
  .container {
    display: flex;
  }
}
```

In this example, the media query checks if the user's device has a screen width of at least 768 pixels. If the condition is met, the styles within the media query block are applied, in this case, changing the display of the **`.container`** element to flex.

You can use multiple expressions within a media query, combining them with logical operators such as **`and`**, **`not`**, or **`only`**. You can also use commas to separate multiple media queries, which acts like an **`OR`** operator, applying the styles if any of the media queries match.

Here's an example with multiple conditions:

```css

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Styles to be applied if the screen width is between 768 and 1024 pixels */
  .container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

In this example, the styles within the media query block are applied only if the user's device has a screen width between 768 and 1024 pixels.

Media queries provide a powerful way to create responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes, enhancing the user experience across a variety of platforms.
