## What is cloud computing?

了解云计算资源的类型可能需要付出大量时间和费用。企业需要通过耗时数个月之久的采购流程来购买物理服务器和基础架构的其他资源，还要为云计算架构提供支持。由此获得的系统需要占用物理空间，通常是配备充足的电源和冷却设施的专用房间。配置和部署系统后，企业需要安排专家对其进行管理。

在需求激增或业务扩张时，这种耗时的流程难以随之扩展。企业可能要获得超出实际需求的计算资源，导致利用率低下。

云计算能以可扩缩的按需服务形式提供计算资源，从而解决这些问题。详细了解 [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/why-google-cloud?hl=zh-cn)，这是 Google 提供的一套云计算服务模型。

Cloud computing is a technology that enables the delivery of computing resources, such as storage, processing power, software, and services, over the internet. Instead of relying on local hardware and software, users can access these resources on-demand from remote data centers operated by cloud service providers.

Some key benefits of cloud computing include:

1. Scalability: Cloud computing allows users to easily scale resources up or down as their needs change, without having to invest in new hardware or software.
2. Cost savings: Users can save on infrastructure costs by only paying for the resources they actually use, instead of purchasing and maintaining their own hardware and software.
3. Accessibility: Cloud resources can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, allowing for increased flexibility and remote work capabilities.
4. Reliability: Cloud service providers typically have robust infrastructure and redundancy measures in place, which can help ensure high availability and minimize downtime.
5. Automatic updates: Cloud providers often handle software updates and maintenance, ensuring that users always have access to the latest features and security patches.

Cloud computing services are generally categorized into three main models: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each model offers different levels of control, flexibility, and management for the end-users.

## Definition of cloud computing

云计算就是指通过互联网，以按需服务的形式提供计算资源。这样企业就无需自行采购、配置或管理资源，而且只需要为实际使用的资源付费。

云计算服务模型有三种：[基础架构即服务](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-iaas?hl=zh-cn)提供计算和存储服务、平台即服务提供用于开发和部署的开发环境以构建云端应用，而软件即服务则以服务的形式提供应用。

## ****了解云计算的工作原理****

How does cloud computing work:

云计算服务模型基于通过互联网共享按需计算资源、软件和信息的概念。公司或个人付费访问位于服务提供商拥有和管理的远程服务器上的共享资源的虚拟池，包括计算、存储和网络服务。

云计算的众多优势之一是，您只需为实际用量付费。这使组织无需购买和维护自己的物理数据中心和服务器，能够更快、更高效地进行扩缩。

简单来说，云计算使用网络（通常是互联网）将用户连接到云平台，用户在该平台上请求和访问租借的计算服务。中央服务器会处理客户端设备与服务器之间的所有通信，以进行数据交换。安全和隐私保护功能是确保这些信息安全的常见组成部分。

在采用云计算架构时，不存在放之四海而皆准的解决方案。适合其他公司的做法可能不适合您和您的业务需求。事实上，这种灵活性和多样性正是云的特点之一，这使企业可以快速适应不断变化的市场或指标。

有三种不同的云计算部署模型：公有云、私有云和混合云。

- **[公有云](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-public-cloud?hl=zh-cn)**由第三方云服务提供商运营。它们通过互联网提供计算、存储和网络资源，使企业能够根据其独特的要求和业务目标访问共享的按需资源。
- **私有云**由单个组织构建、管理和拥有，并以非公开方式托管在自己的数据中心（通常称为“本地”）内。私有云可提供更强的数据控制、安全和管理功能，同时内部用户仍能够受益于共享的计算、存储和网络资源池。
- **[混合云](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-hybrid-cloud?hl=zh-cn)**结合了公有云和私有云模型，使企业能够利用公有云服务，并仍可保持私有云架构中常见的安全和合规功能。

The cloud computing service model is based on the concept of sharing on-demand computing resources, software and information over the Internet. Companies or individuals pay for access to a virtual pool of shared resources, including computing, storage and network services, located on remote servers owned and managed by the service provider.

One of the many advantages of cloud computing is that you only pay for the actual usage. This eliminates the need for organizations to purchase and maintain their own physical data centers and servers, enabling faster and more efficient scaling.

Simply put, cloud computing uses a network (usually the Internet) to connect users to a cloud platform, where they request and access rented computing services. A central server handles all communications between client devices and the server for data exchange. Security and privacy protection features are common components to ensure the security of these information.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to adopting a cloud computing architecture. What works for other companies may not work for you and your business needs. In fact, this flexibility and diversity is one of the characteristics of the cloud, which allows organizations to quickly adapt to changing markets or metrics.

There are three different cloud deployment models: public, private, and hybrid clouds.

- **[Public clouds](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-public-cloud?hl=zh-cn)** are operated by third-party cloud service providers. They provide computing, storage and network resources over the Internet, enabling enterprises to access shared on-demand resources based on their unique requirements and business goals.
- **Private clouds** are built, managed and owned by individual organizations and are hosted in their own data centers (often referred to as "local") in a non-public manner. Private clouds provide greater data control, security and management capabilities, while internal users still benefit from a shared pool of compute, storage and network resources.
- **[Hybrid Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-hybrid-cloud?hl=zh-cn)** combines public and private cloud models, enabling organizations to leverage public cloud services while still maintaining the security and compliance features common to private cloud architectures.

## Benefit of cloud computing

### **经济实惠**

无论使用哪种云计算服务模型，企业只需要为其使用的计算资源付费。他们无需为了应对需求高峰或业务增长高峰而过度筹备数据中心资源，可以部署 IT 人员去专注处理更具战略意义的计划。

# **云计算的类型**

根据业务需要的控制、灵活性和管理级别，有三种主要的云计算服务模式可供选择：

- **[基础架构即服务](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-iaas?hl=zh-cn) (IaaS)** 可让您按需访问 IT 基础架构服务，包括计算、存储、网络和虚拟化。它可为 IT 资源提供最高级别的控制，与传统的本地 IT 资源最相似。
- **[平台即服务](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-paas?hl=zh-cn) (PaaS)** 提供云应用开发需要的所有硬件和软件资源。采用 PaaS 时，企业无需管理和维护底层基础架构，可以专注于应用开发。
- **软件即服务 (SaaS)** 以服务的形式提供完整的应用栈，从底层基础架构到维护，到应用软件本身的更新。SaaS 解决方案通常是最终用户应用，服务和基础架构由云服务提供商管理和维护。

There are several types of cloud computing deployment models and service models. Here, we will discuss the four primary deployment models and the three main service models.

Deployment Models:

1. Public Cloud: In a public cloud, the infrastructure, computing resources, and services are owned, managed, and operated by a third-party cloud service provider. These resources are shared among multiple users and organizations, making this model highly scalable and cost-effective. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure.
2. Private Cloud: A private cloud is dedicated to a single organization, offering more control, security, and customization options compared to a public cloud. The infrastructure can be managed either by the organization itself or by a third-party provider. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or at an offsite data center.
3. Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud combines elements of both public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the best features of each. In this model, sensitive data and applications can be hosted on a private cloud, while less critical resources can utilize the public cloud for cost savings and scalability.
4. Community Cloud: A community cloud is a shared infrastructure used by a group of organizations with similar requirements, such as security, compliance, or specific industry needs. This type of cloud can be managed by the organizations themselves or by a third-party provider.

## **Service Models:**

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): IaaS provides users with virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networking. Users have control over the operating system, applications, and other configurations, while the cloud provider manages the underlying hardware. Examples include AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.
2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS offers a development environment in the cloud, including tools, libraries, and services needed to build, test, and deploy applications. Users can focus on creating and managing their applications, while the cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure, middleware, and runtime environments. Examples include Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, and Heroku.
3. Software as a Service (SaaS): SaaS provides users with access to fully functional software applications over the internet. The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, application, and data, making SaaS the most hands-off option for users. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, and Salesforce.

# What is Cloud Economics? An intro guide to measuring Costs.

Businesses are increasingly interested in the economics of cloud computing. For instance, what are the financial implications of moving to the cloud versus staying on-premises? And what’s the best strategy for optimizing cloud consumption to get the best value from cloud resources?

This article takes a look at some of the key concepts of cloud economics, and how your business can leverage **cloud cost intelligence** to maximize the value of your investment.

# **What Is Cloud Economics?**

**Cloud economics is the study of the benefits, costs, and principles of cloud computing.** It involves understanding: The total cost of ownership (TCO) of cloud computing, the benefits of the cloud over on-premises models, and cost optimization strategies that will maximize ROI on your cloud investment.

Cloud economics is not just about costs in actual monetary terms, but also about the opportunity costs of the cloud and the peculiarities of managing costs in a highly dynamic environment.

### **1. Cloud total cost of ownership (TCO)**

In cloud computing, [the total cost of ownership](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-tco) (TCO) is the total cost of adopting, operating, and provisioning cloud infrastructure. TCO is helpful for understanding your return on investment.

Businesses have always performed TCO analysis for traditional IT infrastructure. However, performing TCO analysis for cloud computing can be challenging because the environment is inherently more complex and dynamic than on-premises environments.

Getting an accurate TCO for cloud computing means capturing the purchase price of on-premises vs. cloud solutions as well as the intangible costs of either solution. In practice, this means:

- Calculating the cost of your current IT infrastructure
- Estimating the total cost of [cloud adoption](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-infrastructure) (including migration costs)
- Quantifying the intangible benefits of the cloud (You can read a step-by-step guide for calculating cloud TCO [here.](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-tco))

The overall goal is to achieve a lower TCO compared to on-premises infrastructure, but it can also be about justifying a higher TCO by listing the intangible benefits associated with the cloud, such as agility and greater speed to market.

[Sifting through cost data isn’t a good use of time. CloudZero transforms costs into relevant dimensions — like dev teams, product features, and environments — then provides views, anomaly alerts, and more, just for the teams responsible for them. Click here to learn more.](https://www.cloudzero.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=f417eed0-0b7a-44b6-9ed0-c4329f2c97b4&signature=AAH58kHIjctMdryYKhrA_kbp1V7kOhTF3w&pageId=47095811358&placement_guid=238fdb50-8322-4270-adc5-bb81a27c98ab&click=ef4bc19b-ac14-42ed-be82-9b72453178b9&hsutk=&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudzero.com%2Fblog%2Fcloud-economics&portal_id=2983524&redirect_url=APefjpFyMxfXBT8j3pHgm-DPTTWdBYhFFduTKjnrDL3wBQSlqucnRrjLxB0GSEU0YI40zj7zqTDzBIaAUOvkMtiksnioZ7GzckR0uLExnoIFOAH27Vgyy_DXwXFp1hKLub9h0pVgZoaL)

![https://www.cloudzero.com/hubfs/pages/relevant-cost-visibility.svg](https://www.cloudzero.com/hubfs/pages/relevant-cost-visibility.svg)

### **2. CAPEX to OPEX switch**

Cloud computing uses a different pricing model from traditional computing and this affects how businesses account for cost. The move from capital expenses (CAPEX) to operating expenses (OPEX) is a key difference, and it affects how businesses gauge profitability in the cloud.

In traditional IT environments, computing costs are predictable and relatively fixed. A business pays for the computing capacity it needs upfront and uses the capacity over time. Calculating the total cost of ownership in this setup is fairly straightforward. In contrast, cloud providers adopt a pay-as-you-go model and most services do not require any upfront commitment.

The implication is that your business will have variable cloud computing bills that depend on the services you use and how they are consumed. While this model may save your business upfront capital expenditure, it can become a huge financial suck if resources are not managed properly.

When moving to or operating in the cloud, it is important to develop and implement cloud cost optimization strategies that will help regulate your cloud costs. For example, [CloudZero’s cost intelligence platform](https://www.cloudzero.com/) helps you [track the cost of migrating to AWS](https://www.cloudzero.com/solutions/aws-migration-cost-savings) and thereafter provides insights that help you [reduce your AWS bill.](https://www.cloudzero.com/reduce-aws-bill)

### **3. Elasticity**

With on-premises systems and traditional IT environments, there’s a cost associated with anticipating demand. Traditional IT environments are built to anticipate peaks, which means you buy and maintain excess computing capacity in anticipation of those peak days. For most businesses, that’s a significant cost for something that’s rarely — if ever — used.

Cloud computing eliminates the need for over-provisioning because you pay only for what you use. Cloud computing platforms, such as AWS, dynamically allocate resources to projects and processes, ensuring that a business has the right amount of resources it needs at any given time. This increases cost efficiency and allows businesses to optimize resource usage.

This elasticity is one of the most appealing aspects of cloud computing and a major selling point when making a case for switching to the cloud.

### **4. On-demand pricing**

On-demand pricing is a fundamentally different economic approach to computing power. Outside of the cloud, you’d buy a fixed amount of computing capacity or a physical server that you own. But in the cloud, you switch to on-demand pricing, so your costs become elastic.

This means cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control if you are not monitoring them regularly and making data-driven decisions.

[Unexpected cost fluctuations can cost your company thousands of dollars if left unchecked or unspotted. To prevent expensive cost overruns, CloudZero uses machine learning to identify cost anomalies when they happen and immediately alert the teams who need to know via Slack. Click here to learn more.](https://www.cloudzero.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=eec60279-47f9-4e41-a8fe-f97c0b9c4981&signature=AAH58kH2fWuKidvn8KfT9eSJaxL0YJEeAA&pageId=47095811358&placement_guid=208b1b7f-ceb8-4d63-bbca-f4fabd5a7d38&click=53c42c27-c733-4f11-8739-f46b1eefc8c9&hsutk=&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cloudzero.com%2Fblog%2Fcloud-economics&portal_id=2983524&redirect_url=APefjpE0GRrCVC_d6_0TARH0PjNKj7Ypi-uLtVxqBwZ5kFMZWUYDnYGw3HOIFaMNY6_7L1MDRnhRPDL-OfQUBTcfN3cCuj9i1u8lzDdND9BXAtb-uw7-mAmF2rtTkHUWl_YlcsEyi4HG)

# **The Concept Of Cloud Cost Intelligence**

One of the key things to remember when moving to the cloud is that a lot of people will be involved in cloud economics who may not necessarily be in core finance departments.

In classic IT infrastructure and computing, only a few people were involved in the economics of computing, including IT hardware people, who were responsible for creating the infrastructure, and finance personnel who approved those expenses and managed budgets.

**In the cloud, many decisions that impact cloud cost are made outside of finance and IT teams.** These include:

- Engineers, who decide which services to use to deliver software
- The product team, who decides how to price the licensing for software
- The marketing team, who determines product-led growth strategies

**At CloudZero, we believe that economic success in the cloud requires that everyone in a company understands their contribution to cloud costs in their part of the business.**

[Cloud cost intelligence](https://www.cloudzero.com/cloud-cost-intelligence) is about democratizing cost knowledge so everyone is empowered to maximize the benefit of the cloud.

**Businesses that employ cloud cost intelligence are more likely to succeed in optimizing cloud costs because they:**

1. Have a good understanding of how their cost structure is different in the cloud compared to a non-cloud environment.
2. Ensure that engineers and all relevant participants understand this difference.
3. Give all relevant stakeholders visibility into how their workloads affect cost so everyone can collectively make good decisions that lead to higher profitability.

# **Understanding AWS Cloud Economics With CloudZero**

When relevant stakeholders don’t have access to cost knowledge, it’s difficult to get a grip on costs. That’s where CloudZero comes in.

CloudZero’s cost intelligence platform helps you [understand your cloud unit economics](https://www.cloudzero.com/solutions/cost-per-customer) by aligning your cloud costs to key business metrics, such as cost per customer or product feature.

![https://www.cloudzero.com/hubfs/blog/cloudzero-cost-per-customer.webp](https://www.cloudzero.com/hubfs/blog/cloudzero-cost-per-customer.webp)

This data can be distributed to respective teams without giving people access to the master billing account.

Our customer [Malwarebytes](https://www.cloudzero.com/customers/malwarebytes) provides an excellent example of cloud cost intelligence at work. Before adopting CloudZero, the company had already been taking steps to track and manage costs, including implementing an aggressive tagging policy and using a cost management tool that allowed the DevOps team to report on their AWS bill.

The problem was that they were spending up to 10 hours a week drilling into reports and communicating with various teams to help them understand their cloud spend.

CloudZero made it possible for them to attribute AWS costs to specific products and decentralize cost management. DevOps immediately gained granular visibility into their cloud spend and could confidently explain their AWS expenses to the executive team.

The best part: The engineering team also became more cost-conscious and now had the ability to make informed decisions about the products they were building. As a result, Malwarebytes is now better positioned to optimize its cloud costs going forward.

# As a service

What are Iaas, Paas and Saas?

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are the three most popular types of cloud service offerings. They are sometimes referred to as cloud service models or cloud computing service models.

- [IaaS, or infrastructure as a service](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas), is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud.
- [PaaS, or platform as a service](https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas), is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.
- [SaaS, or software as a service](https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas), is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.

IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are not mutually exclusive. Many mid-sized businesses use more than one, and most large enterprises use all three.

'As a service' refers to the way IT assets are consumed in these offerings - and to the essential difference between [cloud computing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing) and traditional IT. In traditional IT, an organization consumes IT assets - hardware, system software, development tools, applications - by purchasing them, installing them, managing them and maintaining them in its own on-premises data center. In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages and maintains the assets; the customer consumes them via an Internet connection, and pays for them on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

So the chief advantage of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS or any 'as a service' solution is economic: A customer can access and scale the IT capabilities it needs for a predictable cost, without the expense and overhead of purchasing and maintaining everything in its own data center. But there are additional advantages specific to each of these solutions.

# IaaS

IaaS is on-demand access to cloud-hosted computing infrastructure - servers, storage capacity and networking resources - that customers can provision, configure and use in much the same way as they use on-premises hardware. The difference is that the cloud service provider hosts, manages and maintains the hardware and computing resources in its own data centers. IaaS customers use the hardware via an internet connection, and pay for that use on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

Typically IaaS customers can choose between [virtual machines (VMs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines) hosted on shared physical hardware (the cloud service provider manages virtualization) or bare metal servers on dedicated (unshared) physical hardware. Customers can provision, configure and operate the servers and infrastructure resources via a graphical dashboard, or programmatically through [application programming interfaces (APIs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api).

IaaS can be thought of as the original 'as a service' offering: Every major cloud service provider - Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure - began by offering some form of IaaS.

**Benefits of IaaS**

Compared to traditional IT, IaaS gives customers more flexibility build out computing resources as needed, and to scale them up or down in response to spikes or slow-downs in traffic. IaaS lets customers avoid the up-front expense and overhead of purchasing and maintaining its own on-premises data center. It also eliminates the constant trade-off between the waste of purchasing excess on-premises capacity to accommodate spikes, versus the poor performance or outages that can result from not having enough capacity for unanticipated traffic bursts or growth.

Other benefits of IaaS include:

- **Higher availability**: With IaaS a company can create redundant servers easily, and even create them in other geographies to ensure availability during local power outages or physical disasters.
- **Lower latency, improved performance:** Because IaaS providers typically operate data centers in multiple geographies, IaaS customers can locate apps and services closer to users to minimize latency and maximize performance.
- **Improved responsiveness**: Customers can provision resources in a matter of minutes, test new ideas quickly and quickly roll out new ideas to more users.
- **Comprehensive security:** With a high-level of security on-site, at data centers, and via encryption, organizations can often take advantage of more advanced security and protection they could provide if they hosted the cloud infrastructure in-house.
- **Faster access to best-of-breed technology**: Cloud providers compete with each other by providing the latest technologies to their users, IaaS customers can take advantage of these technologies much earlier (and at far less cost) than they can implement them on premises.

**IaaS use cases**

Common uses of IaaS include:

- **Disaster recovery**: Instead of setting up redundant servers in multiple locations, IaaS can deploy its [disaster recovery](https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery) solution to the cloud provider's existing geographically-dispersed infrastructure.
- **Ecommerce**: IaaS is an excellent option for online retailers that frequently see spikes in traffic. The ability to scale up during periods of high demand and high-quality security are essential in today’s 24-7 retail industry.
- **Internet of Things (IoT), event processing, [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence)**: IaaS makes it easier to set up and scale up data storage and computing resources for these and other applications that work with huge volumes of data.
- **Startups**: Startups can't afford to sink capital into on-premises IT infrastructure. IaaS gives them access to enterprise-class data center capabilities without the up-front investment in hardware and management overhead.
- **Software development**: With IaaS, the infrastructure for testing and development environments can be set up much more quickly than on-premises. (However, this use case is better suited to PaaS, as you'll read in the next section.)

# PaaS

PaaS provides a cloud-based platform for developing, running, managing applications.  The cloud services provider hosts, manages and maintains all the hardware and software included in the platform - servers (for development, testing and deployment), operating system (OS) software, storage, networking, databases, middleware, runtimes, frameworks, development tools - as well as related services for security, operating system and software upgrades, backups and more.

Users access the PaaS through a graphical user interface (GUI), where development or DevOps teams can collaborate on all their work across the entire application lifecycle including coding, integration, testing, delivery, deployment, and feedback.

Examples of PaaS solutions include  AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.

**Benefits of PaaS**

The primary benefit of PaaS  is that it allows customers to build, test, deploy run, update and scale applications more quickly and cost-effectively than they could if they had to build out and manage their own on-premises platform. Other benefits include:

- **Faster time to market**: PaaS enables development teams to spin-up development, testing and production environments in minutes, vs. weeks or months.
- **Low- to no-risk testing and adoption of new technologies**: PaaS platforms typically include access to a wide range of the latest resources up and down the application stack. This allows companies to test new operating systems, languages, and other tools without having to make substantial investments in them, or in the infrastructure required to run them.
- **Simplified collaboration**: As a cloud-based service, PaaS provides a shared software development environment, giving development and operations teams access to all the tools they need, from anywhere with an Internet connection.
- **A more scalable approach**: With PaaS, organizations can purchase additional capacity for building, testing, staging and running applications whenever they need it.
- **Less to manage**: PaaS offloads infrastructure management, patches, updates and other administrative tasks to the cloud service provider.

**PaaS use cases**

PaaS can advance a number of development and IT initiatives including:

- **API development and management**: With its built-in frameworks, PaaS makes it easier for teams to develop, run, manage and secure APIs for sharing data and functionality between applications.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: PaaS supports a range of programming languages (Java, Python, Swift, etc.), tools and application environments used for IoT application development and real-time processing of data from IoT devices.
- **Agile development and DevOps**: PaaS solutions typically cover all the requirements of a [DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops) toolchain, and provide built-in automation to support [continuous integration](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-integration) and [continuous delivery](https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-delivery) (CI/CD).
- **Cloud-native development and hybrid cloud strategy**: PaaS solutions support [cloud-native](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native) development technologies - [microservices](https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices), [containers](https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers), [Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes), [serverless computing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless) - that enable developers to build once, then deploy and manage consistently across [private cloud](https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud), [public cloud](https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud) and on-premises environments.

# SaaS

SaaS (sometimes called cloud application services) is cloud-hosted, ready-to-use application software. Users pay a monthly or annual fee to use a complete application from within a web browser, desktop client or mobile app. The application and all of the infrastructure required to deliver it - servers, storage, networking, middleware, application software, data storage - are hosted and managed by the SaaS vendor.

The vendor manages all upgrades and patches to the software, usually invisibly to customers. Typically, the vendor ensures a level of availability, performance and security as part of a service level agreement (SLA). Customers can add more users and data storage on demand at additional cost.

Today, anyone who uses a or mobile phone almost certainly uses some form of SaaS. Email, social media, and cloud file storage solutions (such as Dropbox or Box) are examples of SaaS applications people use every day in their personal lives. Popular business or enterprise SaaS solutions include Salesforce (customer relationship management software), HubSpot (marketing software), Trello (workflow management), Slack (collaboration and messaging), and Canva (graphics). Many applications designed originally for the desktop (e.g., Adobe Creative Suite) are now available as SaaS (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud).

**Benefits of SaaS**

The main benefit of SaaS is that it offloads all infrastructure and application management to the SaaS vendor. All the user has to do is create an account, pay the fee and start using the application. The vendor handles everything else, from maintaining the server hardware and software to managing user access and security, storing and managing data, implementing upgrades and patches and more.

Other benefits of SaaS include:

- **Minimal risk**: Many SaaS products offer a free trial period, or low monthly fees that let customers try the software to see if it will meet their needs, with little or no financial risk.
- **Anytime/anywhere productivity**: Users can work with SaaS apps on any device with a browser and an internet connection.
- **Easy scalability**: Adding users is as simple as registering and paying for new seats; customers can purchase more data storage for a nominal charge.

Some SaaS vendors even enable customization of their product by providing a companion PaaS solution. One well-known example is Heroku, a PaaS solution for Salesforce.

**SaaS use cases**

Today, just about any personal or employee productivity application is available as SaaS; specific use cases are too numerous to mention (some are listed above). If an end user or organization can find a SaaS solution with the required functionality, in most cases it will provide a significantly simpler, more scalable and more cost-effective alternative to on-premises software.

SaaS vs. PaaS vs. IaaS: management ease vs. control

SaaS, Paas, IaaS are not mutually exclusive; most organizations use more than one, and many larger organizations today use all three, often in combination with traditional IT.

Obviously, the as-a-service solution a customer chooses depends first on the functionality the customer requires, and the expertise it has on staff. For example, an organization without the in-house IT expertise for configuring and operating remote servers isn't well matched to IaaS; an organization without a development team has no need for PaaS.

But in some cases, any of the three 'as-a-service' models will offer a viable solution. In these cases, organizations typically compare the alternatives based on the management ease they offer, vs. the control they give up.

For example, suppose a large organization wants to deliver a customer relationship management (CRM) application to its sales team. It could:

- *Choose a SaaS CRM solution*, offloading all day-to-day management to the third-party vendor, but also giving up all control over features and functionality, data storage, user access and security.
- *Choose a PaaS solution* *and build a custom CRM application*. In this case, the company would offload management of infrastructure and application development resources to the cloud service provider. The customer would retain complete control over application features, but it would also assume responsibility for managing the application and associated data.
- *Build out backend IT infrastructure on the cloud using IaaS, and use it to build its own development platform and application*. The organization's IT team would have complete control over operating systems and server configurations, but also bear the burden of managing and maintaining them, along with the development platform and applications that run on them.
