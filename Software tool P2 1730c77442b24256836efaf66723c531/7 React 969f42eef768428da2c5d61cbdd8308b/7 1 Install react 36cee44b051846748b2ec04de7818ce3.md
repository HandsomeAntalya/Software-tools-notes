# 7.1 Install react

## Nodejs and NPM

JavaScript's original selling point was that it runs in the browser. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is a JavaScript runtime without a browser, so you can for example write a server / back-end in JavaScript too. Using a library called [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), you can even write desktop apps in JavaScript/NodeJS (Electron is essentially google's Chrome browser without the branding, so you can use it to build your own user interface.) We will need NodeJS to run React, which compiles JSX code into JavaScript and HTML.

NodeJS comes with its own package manager, NPM (NodeJS Package Manager). The shell command to run it is `npm`, but there is also `npx` which downloads the latest version of a package and immediately runs it, if it contains a command-line tool.

- Install NodeJS for your operating system. On alpine, use `sudo apk add nodejs npm`; for other operating systems you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) or use your system's package manager, if available.

### What is NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable, high-performance applications using JavaScript. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become a popular choice for building web applications, APIs, and server-side applications.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it well-suited for building real-time, data-intensive applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent connections. With Node.js, developers can write server-side code using the same language as their client-side code, which can help improve developer productivity and code maintainability.

Node.js provides a rich set of built-in modules, including modules for working with HTTP, file system, and streams, and it also has a robust package ecosystem called npm (Node Package Manager) that makes it easy to install and manage third-party packages and dependencies.

In summary, Node.js is a powerful, lightweight, and scalable platform for building server-side applications using JavaScript. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, and rich set of built-in modules and packages make it a popular choice for building real-time, data-intensive applications on the web.

## Your first React app

- Create a new react app with `npx create-react-app FOLDERNAME`. You cannot call the folder `react` itself, so please choose a different name. Downloading and preparing everything for the first time might take a while.

*After we key in ***npx create-react-app reactapp***, we got the following information and it takes a while loading it.*

- By default, react uses port 3000 for its server. If you want another port, like 8000, edit `package.json` and edit the line

```

"start": "react-scripts start",`
```

to read as follows

```

"start": "PORT=8000 react-scripts start",
```

- Start the react app with `npm start` inside the folder with the `package.json` and open your browser on `localhost:8000` or whichever port you are using (the default is 3000). You should see a message "Edit `src/App.js` and save to reload." in your browser.

*if you want to change the port number, you can first :* 

 1.   nano package.json

1. and then add this line inside

1. Then if we run it again, the port will become 4000;

*Well after that we can try to run it by* 

```bash
cd reactapp
npm start
```

*and in my terminal we get:*

*And the web page looks like this: localhost:3000*

## Explore the Code

Have a look at the structure of the project files:

![截屏2023-04-20 14.21.32.png](7%201%20Install%20react%2036cee44b051846748b2ec04de7818ce3/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-20_14.21.32.png)

- `package.json` is the configuration file (like the `pom.xml` for Java/maven).
- The page being served is `public/index.html` although the server replaces `%PUBLIC_URL%` itself (in development this just becomes the empty string). Note the contents of the page are essentially `<div id="root"></div>`, but if you look at the source in the browser (Control+U) you will see that react has added a line at the end of the body pulling in the JavaScript files. If you look with the developer tools (F12) you will see that the content of the app has been added as a child of the root div.
- The code lives in `src/`, mainly in `src/App.js`. The default code uses a function style component rather than a class style one, but the elements you see in the JSX code here (the HTML-embedded-in-JavaScript) are the ones that you saw in your browser inside the root div.
