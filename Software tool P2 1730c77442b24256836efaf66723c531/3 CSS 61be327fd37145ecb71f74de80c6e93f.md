**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language). CSS allows developers to separate the presentation and layout of a webpage from its content, which is essential for maintaining clean and well-organized code.*CSS（级联样式表）**是一种用于描述使用HTML（超文本标记语言）或XHTML（可扩展超文本标记语言）编写的文档的外观和格式的样式表语言。CSS允许开发人员将网页的演示和布局与其内容分开，这对于维护干净和有组织的代码至关重要。

Here are some key concepts you should know about CSS:

1. Selectors 选择器: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are various types of selectors, such as element selectors (e.g., **`p`**, **`h1`**, **`div`**), class selectors (e.g., **`.classname`**), and ID selectors (e.g., **`#idname`**).CSS使用选择器来定位特定的HTML元素并对其应用样式。有各种类型的选择器，如元素选择器（例如**`p`**，**`h1`**，**`div`**），类选择器（例如**`.classname`**）和ID选择器（例如**`#idname`**）。
2. Properties and Values 属性和值: CSS properties define the style attributes (e.g., **`color`**, **`font-size`**, **`border`**), while values define the specific appearance of those attributes (e.g., **`red`**, **`16px`**, **`2px solid black`**). Properties and values are used together within rulesets to create styles.CSS属性定义样式属性（例如，**`color`**，**`font-size`**，**`border`**），而值定义这些属性的具体外观（例如，**`red`**，**`16px`**，**`2px solid black`**）。 属性和值一起在规则集中使用以创建样式。
3. Rulesets规则集：A ruleset consists of a selector, followed by a declaration block that contains one or more declarations. Each declaration is a combination of a property and its value, separated by a colon and ending with a semicolon. 一个规则集由选择器组成，后面跟着一个声明块，其中包含一个或多个声明。每个声明都是属性和它的值的组合，用冒号分隔，以分号结尾。

Example of a ruleset:

```css

h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

1. Cascade: The "cascading" in Cascading Style Sheets refers to how browsers determine the final style for an element when multiple conflicting styles are applied. The cascade follows a specific order of precedence: inline styles, internal stylesheets, external stylesheets, browser default styles, and user styles.
2. Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to their children, allowing for a more consistent look throughout the website. For example, font properties like **`font-family`** and **`font-size`** are often inherited.
3. Box Model: The CSS box model is a fundamental concept for understanding how elements are displayed on a webpage. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. Each of these properties can be manipulated to control the layout and spacing of elements.
4. Responsive Design: CSS allows developers to create responsive designs, which adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries can be used to apply styles based on the device's properties, such as viewport width or screen resolution.
5. CSS Preprocessors: Tools like Sass, Less, and Stylus extend the functionality of CSS by allowing developers to use variables, nested rules, and functions, among other features. These preprocessors compile the extended syntax into standard CSS, which browsers can understand.

These concepts are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to CSS, but they provide a solid foundation to start learning and experimenting with web design.

1. Inline styles: Inline styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the **`style`** attribute. The style rules are written within the element itself. This method is generally not recommended as it can lead to code that is hard to maintain and can clutter the HTML code.
Example:

```html
<p style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph with inline styles.</p>
```

2. Internal stylesheets: Internal stylesheets are placed within the **`<style>`** element inside the **`<head>`** section of the HTML document. They define styles for elements within that specific document.
Example:

```html
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 18px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

3. External stylesheets: External stylesheets are created in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the **`<link>`** element. This method is the most recommended way of styling, as it allows you to keep your styles separate from your HTML, making it easier to maintain and reuse styles across multiple pages.
Example:
Create a file called **`styles.css`**:

```css
p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

Link it to your HTML document:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

4. Browser default styles: Browsers come with a set of default styles applied to various HTML elements. These styles provide a basic level of formatting, such as margins, paddings, and font sizes. You can override these default styles using your own CSS.

5. User styles: Some users may have their own stylesheets that they apply to websites for accessibility or personal preferences. These styles can override the styles specified by the website's author. User styles can be implemented using browser extensions or built-in browser features.

The overall syntax is very simple 

![截屏2023-04-22 15.43.44.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_15.43.44.png)

![截屏2023-04-22 15.44.14.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_15.44.14.png)

p . important would refer to all the p element of class = “important”, not all the div element of class = “important”. 

A CSS rule consists of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block.

1. **Selector**: A selector is a pattern that matches one or more HTML elements on a web page. Selectors determine which elements the CSS rules should be applied to. There are several types of selectors:
    - **Element (Type) Selector**: Matches all elements of a given type. For example, **`p`** selects all paragraph elements.
    - **Class Selector**: Matches all elements with a specific class attribute. Class selectors are denoted by a dot (**`.`**) followed by the class name, e.g., **`.my-class`**.
    - **ID Selector**: Matches a single element with a specific ID attribute. ID selectors are denoted by a hash (**`#`**) followed by the ID name, e.g., **`#my-id`**.
    - **Attribute Selector**: Matches elements with a specific attribute or attribute value. For example, **`[data-type="example"]`** selects elements with a **`data-type`** attribute value of "example."
    - **Pseudo-class Selector**: Matches elements based on their state or position in the document, such as **`:hover`**, **`:focus`**, or **`:nth-child()`**.
    - **Pseudo-element Selector**: Matches parts of an element, such as **`::before`**, **`::after`**, or **`::first-letter`**.
    
    You can also combine selectors or create more complex patterns using combinators like descendant, child, adjacent sibling, or general sibling.
    
2. **Declaration Block**: A declaration block is a set of CSS declarations enclosed in curly braces (**`{}`**). Each declaration defines a style property and its value, separated by a colon (**`:`**) and terminated by a semicolon (**`;`**). For example:
    
    ```css
    font-size: 16px;
    color: blue;
    ```
    

Putting it all together, here's an example of a complete CSS rule:

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
}
```

In this example, the selector is **`p`** (matching all paragraph elements), and the declaration block contains two declarations (setting the **`font-size`** and **`color`** properties). When applied to an HTML document, this CSS rule will style all paragraph elements with a font size of 16 pixels and a blue text color.

The correct syntax for a CSS rule targeting a **`div`** element would be:

```css
div {
  property: value;
}
```

To use CSS with an HTML document, you can either include the styles in a **`<style>`** element within the **`<head>`** of the document, or you can link to an external CSS file using a **`<link>`** element, like this:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

what if we only want the <p> element that inside the <div> but not the other <p> element? 

只想要<div>内的<p>

**.container p** → refers to all the <p> element of the container class. 

This is a **descendant selector.** It selects all the **`<p>`** elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of elements with the class **`container`**. **in this example would be both <p>direct child</p> and the <p>descentant</p>.**

![截屏2023-04-22 15.53.30.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_15.53.30.png)

If we only want the ‘direct child’ of the container, we can just:

想要’direct child’ 那部分

**.container > p** → refers to the <p>direct child</p> 

**`.container > p`**: This is a **child selector**. It selects all the **`<p>`** elements that are direct children of elements with the class **`container`**. **it would match only the "direct child" paragraph.**

![截屏2023-04-22 15.55.30.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_15.55.30.png)

**.container ~ p** → all the <p> element that follow the container element.  所有的<p>

**`.container ~ p`**: This is a **general sibling selector**. It selects all the **`<p>`** elements that share the same parent as an element with the class **`container`** and come after the **`.container`** element in the document. In your HTML example, it would match both "para one" and "para two" paragraphs.

**.container + p** → just the element immediately follows after the container. container之后的那个

**`.container + p`**: This is an **adjacent sibling selector**. It selects the **`<p>`** element that immediately follows an element with the class **`container,`** it would match only the "para one" paragraph.

![截屏2023-04-22 15.58.38.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_15.58.38.png)

Here's a summary of which paragraphs each selector would match in your HTML:

- **`.container p`**: direct child, descendant
- **`.container > p`**: direct child
- **`.container ~ p`**: para one, para two
- **`.container + p`**: para one
- .container div p : descendant

If you apply styles using these selectors, each selector will affect the paragraphs as described above.

## Values:

![截屏2023-04-22 16.03.46.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_16.03.46.png)

CSS values are the specific settings assigned to CSS properties in a style rule. They define the appearance and formatting of the selected HTML elements. CSS values can be of different types, such as lengths, percentages, colors, keywords, or even complex expressions.

Here are some common types of CSS values:

1. **Lengths**: Length values can be specified using different units like pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percentage (%), viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax), or others. For example:
    
    ```css
    font-size: 16px;
    padding: 1em;
    width: 50%;
    ```
    
2. **Colors**: Colors can be specified using various formats, such as predefined color keywords (e.g., 'red', 'blue', 'transparent'), hexadecimal values (e.g., '#FF0000'), RGB values (e.g., 'rgb(255, 0, 0)'), RGBA values (e.g., 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)'), or HSL values (e.g., 'hsl(0, 100%, 50%)'). For example:
    
    ```css
    
    color: red;
    background-color: #FF0000;
    border-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
    ```
    
3. **Keywords**: Some CSS properties accept specific keywords as values. These keywords have predefined meanings and can be used to set the property to a specific state. For example:
    
    ```css
    
    display: block;
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
    ```
    
4. **Images and URLs**: Some CSS properties allow you to specify images or other resources using a URL. For example:
    
    ```css
    background-image: url('path/to/image.png');
    ```
    
5. **Numbers and Units**: Some properties require numerical values, sometimes combined with units. For example:
    
    ```css
    
    opacity: 0.5;
    line-height: 1.5;
    z-index: 10;
    ```
    
6. **Complex Values**: Some CSS properties accept complex values, which may include multiple parts, functions, or expressions. For example:
    
    ```css
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08);
    transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);
    ```
    

In a CSS declaration, the property and value are separated by a colon (**`:`**), and the declaration is terminated with a semicolon (**`;`**). The complete set of declarations for a selector is enclosed in curly braces (**`{}`**). For example:

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}
```

In this example, the **`font-size`**, **`color`**, and **`text-align`** properties have the values **`16px`**, **`blue`**, and **`center`**, respectively. These values determine the styling applied to the selected **`<p>`** elements.

padding: the content between content and border within the border. 

margin: content outside the border, outside the border. 

In CSS, the "box model" is a fundamental concept that describes how the layout of HTML elements works. Each element is represented as a rectangular box, which consists of several components: content, padding, border, and margin. These components define the dimensions, positioning, and spacing of elements on the page.

Here's a breakdown of the box model components:

1. **Content**: The content of the box is the actual element's content, such as text, images, or other media. The dimensions of the content box are determined by the element's width and height properties.
2. **Padding**: Padding is the space between the content and the border. It helps to separate the content from the border, making the element more visually appealing. The padding can be set using the **`padding`** property or individual properties like **`padding-top`**, **`padding-right`**, **`padding-bottom`**, and **`padding-left`**.
3. **Border**: The border surrounds the content and padding of the box. It can have a specific style, width, and color, which can be set using the **`border`** property or individual properties like **`border-width`**, **`border-style`**, **`border-color`**, **`border-top`**, **`border-right`**, **`border-bottom`**, and **`border-left`**.
4. **Margin**: Margin is the space outside the border, which separates the element from other elements on the page. The margin can be set using the **`margin`** property or individual properties like **`margin-top`**, **`margin-right`**, **`margin-bottom`**, and **`margin-left`**.

These components together make up the total size of the element's box, which determines how the element is positioned and interacts with other elements on the page. The total width and height of an element's box can be calculated as follows:

- Total width = content width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right
- Total height = content height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom + margin-top + margin-bottom

By understanding and controlling the box model, you can create flexible and responsive designs, control the layout and positioning of elements, and build a more visually appealing website.

Here's an example of how you can set the box model properties in CSS:

```css
.box {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid black;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

This CSS rule defines a box with a content width of 300px, a content height of 200px, 20px of padding on all sides, a 2px solid black border, and a 10px margin on all sides.

2. set the element like margin all the once:  (clockwise) margin: 10px(top) 5px(left) 15px(bottom) 20px(right) 
3. border: define the thickness. 

## Unit of measurement

![截屏2023-04-22 16.25.35.png](3%20CSS%2061be327fd37145ecb71f74de80c6e93f/%25E6%2588%25AA%25E5%25B1%258F2023-04-22_16.25.35.png)

In CSS, there are several units of measurement used to define lengths, sizes, and distances. These units help you specify the dimensions of various properties like width, height, padding, margin, font-size, and more. Here's an overview of the most common units of measurement in CSS:

1. **Absolute units**: Absolute units are fixed and do not depend on the size of the parent element, the screen, or the user's preferences. Some common absolute units are:
    - **`px`** (pixels): A pixel is a screen-based unit that corresponds to a single dot on the screen. Pixels are commonly used for setting dimensions, spacing, and font sizes.
    - **`pt`** (points): A point is equal to 1/72 of an inch. Points are often used in print media, but they can be used on the web as well.
    - **`pc`** (picas): A pica is equal to 12 points or 1/6 of an inch. Like points, picas are more common in print media.
    - **`in`** (inches), **`cm`** (centimeters), **`mm`** (millimeters): These units represent physical measurements and are not commonly used for web design, as they can produce inconsistent results on different screens.
2. **Relative units**: Relative units are based on the size of another value, such as the parent element's font size, the viewport size, or the user's preferences. Some common relative units are:
    - **`em`**: An **`em`** is equal to the computed font size of the element's parent. For example, if the parent element has a font size of 16px, then **`1em`** would be equal to 16px. Ems are commonly used for font sizes, spacing, and responsive design.
    - **`rem`**: A **`rem`** (root em) is similar to an **`em`**, but it is based on the font size of the root element (usually the **`<html>`** element) rather than the parent element. This makes it consistent across the entire document, making it easier to manage styles.(single font size)
    - **`%`** (percentages): Percentage values are relative to another value, such as the parent element's width or height, the viewport size, or the font size. Percentages are commonly used for responsive design and fluid layouts.
    - **`vw`**, **`vh`**, **`vmin`**, **`vmax`**: These units represent a percentage of the viewport's width (vw), height (vh), the smaller dimension (vmin), or the larger dimension (vmax). For example, **`1vw`** is equal to 1% of the viewport's width, making it a useful unit for creating responsive designs that adapt to the screen size. (scale dynamically according to the size of browser window. )
    - **`ex`**: The **`ex`** unit is relative to the x-height of the current font. The x-height is roughly the height of lowercase letters like 'x' in the font. The exact value of **`1ex`** depends on the font being used and its metrics. This unit is less commonly used than **`em`** or **`rem`**, but it can be useful for adjusting the size or positioning of elements relative to the x-height of the font.
    - **`ch`**: The **`ch`** unit is relative to the width of the "0" (zero) character in the current font. This unit can be useful when you want to size elements based on the width of a fixed number of characters in the font. For example, you can use the **`ch`** unit to set the width of a container to display a specific number of monospace characters.
    - **`lh` (line-height)**: The **`lh`** unit is relative to the computed line-height of an element. The line-height property defines the space above and below the text within an element, affecting the vertical spacing of lines of text. Using the **`lh`** unit can help you create consistent vertical rhythm in your designs by setting margins, padding, or other spacing properties relative to the line-height.
    
    Here are some examples using these units:
    
    ```css
    p {
      font-size: 2ex; /* font-size based on the x-height of the current font */
      width: 20ch; /* width based on the width of 20 '0' characters */
      margin-bottom: 1lh; /* margin-bottom based on the computed line-height */
    }
    ```
    
    These units can be helpful in specific situations where you want your styles to adapt to the font metrics or line-height, ensuring a consistent appearance across different fonts or typographic settings.
    

Each unit of measurement has its advantages and use cases, so it's essential to choose the right one based on the design requirements and the desired responsiveness or flexibility of your styles. By using a combination of absolute and relative units, you can create designs that look consistent across various devices and screen sizes.
