# Asynchronous JavaScript

异步脚本语言

In this module, we take a look at [asynchronous](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Asynchronous) [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JavaScript), why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.

- [ ]  Work through "JavaScript first steps" and "JavaScript building blocks" modules before attempting this module.
- [ ]  Try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch if you don't have the ability to create your own files.
- [ ]  Read "Introducing asynchronous JavaScript" to learn about synchronous and asynchronous programming, why we often need to use asynchronous techniques, and the problems related to the way asynchronous functions have historically been implemented in JavaScript.
- [ ]  Read "How to use promises" to learn how to use promise-based APIs and introduce the async and await keywords.
- [ ]  Read "Implementing a promise-based API" to learn how to implement your own promise-based API.
- [ ]  Read "Introducing workers" to learn how to rewrite a long-running synchronous function to use a worker.
- [ ]  Complete the assessment "Sequencing animations" which asks you to use promises to play a set of animations in a particular sequence.

## Prerequisites

Asynchronous JavaScript is a fairly advanced topic, and you are advised to work through [JavaScript first steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) and [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks) modules before attempting this.

**Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you can try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## Guides

[Introducing asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing) 

In this article, we'll learn

about **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming, why we often need to use asynchronous techniques, and the problems related to the way asynchronous functions have historically been implemented in JavaScript.

[How to use promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) Here we'll introduce promises and show how to use promise-based APIs. We'll also introduce the `async` and `await` keywords.

 [Implementing a promise-based API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Implementing_a_promise-based_API) This article will outline how to implement your own promise-based API.

 [Introducing workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing_workers) Workers enable you to run certain tasks in a separate thread to keep your main code responsive. In this article, we'll rewrite a long-running synchronous function to use a worker.

## Assessments

[Sequencing animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Sequencing_animations)

The assessment asks you to use promises to play a set of animations in a particular sequence.
